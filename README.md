# Changelog

## v1.1.1
### Auto-setup feature
No more bundling with a KataGo folder! If you don't already have KataGo, there is now a nifty `Auto-setup` button in the Options menu, allowing you to easily download the appropriate KataGo version for your system.

### Cross-platform compatibility
Versions for Mac and Linux are now live, in addition to Windows.

## v1.1.0
### Moved to Tauri
Changing framework from Electron to Tauri has many advantages.
* **Reduced filesize:** The application has now shrunk from **75.2 MB** down to **11.5 MB!**
* **Truly portable .exe:** The application is a single, lightweight .exe that can be placed anywhere and be associated with .sgf files with no problems.
* **Increased cross-platform compatibility:** This will help bring about Mac, Linux and mobile versions in the near future.

### Interactive Editing
You can now move stones around after they have been placed.
* **Drag-and-drop stone editing:** Right-click any placed stone (or right-click its node in the tree) to enter Edit Mode. The stone will lift off the board and be able to be moved on any other intersection without messing up the rest of the tree.
* **Time-travelling stone editing:** You can edit a stone's placement from any place on the navigation tree. This makes it easier to edit earlier misplaced stones if you are transcribing a game and made a mistake.

### Global Action Engine
* **Undo/Redo:** `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y` now undo/redo stone placements, branch deletions, and drag-and-drop spatial edits.

### Visual Update
* Slight visual changes to make things easier on the eyes.
